        </p>
        
        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> 1tsp active dry yeast </li>
                <li> 3/4 cupp warm water(105°F)</li>
                <li> 1/4 cup sugar </li>
                <li> 1 egg whisked</li>
                <li> 1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li> dash nutmeg</li>
                <li> 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li> 2 tbsp vegetable shortening</li>
                <li> 3 1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li> vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li> powdered sugar</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><h4>Cooking instructions</h4>
            <ol start=1>
                <li>Add ¾ cup warm water to a small bowl. Sprinkle 1 tsp yeast on top and stir to dissolve. Allow the yeast to activate (about 5 minutes).</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl (or stand mixer), add the sugar, egg, salt, nutmeg, heavy cream and shortening. Mix to combine.</li>
                <li>Pour in the activated yeast and mix.</li>
                <li>Add the flour to the mix. Use the dough hook attachment on a stand mixer and mix on medium speed until all of the ingredients are combined and dough is smooth but still slightly sticky. </li>
                <li>Form a ball with the dough and place in a greased bowl. Cover and let rise for about 1 hour. </li>
                <li>Use a deep sided heavy pot and add 3 inches of vegetable oil. Heat over medium high heat until oil reaches 370°F (cooler than this won't cook the beignets fast enough and hotter than this will burn them quite easily).</li>
                <li>On a lightly floured surface roll out the dough until it is ½ inch thick. Use Mickey Cookie cutter to cut out Mickey-shaped pieces of dough.</li>
                <li>Working in batches fry the beignets until golden brown, about 1 minute on each side. </li>
                <li>Use tongs to remove the beignets from the hot oil. Place on a paper towel lined plate to drain. While the beignets are still warm, dust them completely with powdered sugar. Serve immediately. </li>
            </ol>
